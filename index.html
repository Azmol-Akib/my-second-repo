      Shakib Al Hasan is without a doubt the biggest name to have emerged from
      Bangladesh cricket circles. Being a genuine all-rounder, Shakib is a vital
      cog in Bangladesh's line-up. He has been a consistent performer for his
      country, over the years. Shakib first came into notice when he played
      cricket for several villages near his hometown of Magura. He spent time
      honing his skills at a government run sports facility and was picked for
      the Under-19 squad for the tri-series featuring England and Sri Lanka. He
      scored a 86-ball century and picked up three wickets in the final to help
      the team defeat Sri Lanka. This earned him selection for the series
      against Zimbabwe.
